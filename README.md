# Hey there 👋

I’m Mike — a hobbyist developer who loves tinkering with code, learning new tech, and building fun projects in my spare time.  
Right now, I’m deep into a project called **MovieReleaseTracker** 🎬 — an app that helps you follow upcoming movies and get notified when they release in theaters or streaming.

## 🚀 Current Project
### 🎥 MovieReleaseTracker
- **Stack:** Node.js, Express, EJS, Vanilla CSS, Airtable, TMDB API, Brevo (for email notifications)
- **What it does:**  
  - Search movies from TMDB  
  - Follow/unfollow movies  
  - Get notified when they’re released  
  - See streaming and theater release dates

## 🧠 What I’m Learning Right Now
- Writing clean, modular Express routes
- Making my CSS layouts look as good as they work
- Git workflow improvements (hello PowerShell functions 👋)

💡 **Fun fact:** I’m not a professional developer — I just code for the joy of building things that make life easier (and a bit cooler).
